        <h1>Liam Wang's Game Portfolio</h1>
        <div class="large-container"> <h2 style="margin-top: 0cm;">Totally Tanktical</h2>
            <p>I was brought onto this project and made to be the lead programmer.</p>
            <p>Programming-wise, our programming team inherited the project in a difficult to work with state, 
                and were tasked with adding to it. This involved remaking many important system that had convoluted 
                algorithms, confusing architecture, and a lack of proper documentation. As the project progressed, 
                we managed to remake or replace these systems and made them simpler and easier to work with, and 
                overall making the code better.</p>
            <p>My responsibilities and priorities were:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Communicate with the product owners to figure out what features they wanted to add to the game</li>
                <li>Ensure that the product owners were kept up to date on all programming tasks, as well as describe the technical problems we were having in a way they could understand</li>
                <li>Delegate tasks to programmers and ensure each member knew what each was doing without stepping on each other's toes. Along with establishing priorities of what needed to get done before other things.</li>
                <li>Keep up to date with every member of the programming team and the work they were doing, giving feedback and holding discussions about their work.</li>
                <li>To create systems that were understandable for members of the team to use, such as the designers, artists, and other programmers.</li>
                <li>Managing a PlasticSCM repo for our version control, making sure that people were following standards that would ensure everyone could work on the project simultaneously</li>
                <li>Showing off the game at expo events, like PAX East and the Clark IGDA expo.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Systems I worked on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Block pre-placement visual:
                    There was no visual before this system was implemented. Before I could add in a working system, I had to venture into many scripts and fix many bugs that were due to the old system not being designed to work with a visual from the start.
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Systems I remade:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Camera movement:
                    I rebuilt the camera system that was overly complicated and difficult to work with, into a slimmed down system with the same functionality. It has the ability to zoom in and out, pan away from the tank and snap back to it, and the ability to rotate around the object of interest. Much my  work was done to fix bugs caused by the older system being shifted out.
                </li>
                <li>Material Assignment:
                    I rebuilt the systems that were responsible for assigning the right textures for the blocks when being attached and detached from tanks. The old system was difficult to work with, and was a constant source of trouble. I later expanded the systems to handle assigning proper textures for the different damaged states of blocks. It was important to me to make it easy for others to add new kinds of blocks to the system, as well as make it easy to assign the proper material.
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>DELETE SYSTEM 32
            </h2>
            <p>I was the sole programmer for this game.
            Some of the features were a finite state machine for the different enemy AI behaviors.
            Randomly generating the towers that have corresponding enemy spawners.
            Making the screen endlessly scroll.
            Powerups for the player ship.
            Cardinal movement system, and the ability to freely rotate to aim
            </p>

            <p>I also created a UI system that non-programmers could use to quickly link up UI elements and add new ones for non-programmers.
            </p>

            <h2>Ship Shoot
            </h2>
            <p>This was my first game, I made it in two weeks during the "My First Game Jam" jam on Itch.io. It was my first time trying to create a playable game using Scratch. Every asset and feature was made by me.
            </p>

            <p>It features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Custom hit detection</li>
                <li>Custom entity tracking system</li>
                <li>Custom projectile object system</li>
                <li>Custom Enemy AI</li>
                <li>Custom Text Printing</li>
            </ul>
